~~Thanks to runme.io and [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/5f7445bfa4d0), anyone can quickly spin up their own demo instance of Wiki.js for a quick test drive.~~

**Unfortunately runme.io is shutting down and demos are no longer available. We are looking at alternatives.**{.red--text .text--darken-2}

> **Did you know?** This documentation website is running Wiki.js!
